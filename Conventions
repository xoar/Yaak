-a Entity is just a yobject with a name.

-Every subtask has a construcotr and a process function

-the process function deallocates the object. 
	there is no need of a usage after processing a subtask.

-a entity or a yobject like a character have a destructor and FreePointerStruct function:
	the destructor deallocates the object and the pointer struct while the freepointer data only free the c struct and left the object alive.

-a user should use the id functions for acessing a yobject or entity.

- a destructor normally also removes the object from the used container.

- a container yobject should register himself by construction.
