- add support for entity id variables for the set anim picture and set picture dsl

- when c++ support stackfull coroutines: change task to coroutines.
  can use yield for áºƒaiting.no need for semaphores and condition variables anymore.

- could we catch the wait exceptions in the scheduler instead of each task.
  easier for new beginners. no need in catching them at task lvl ?
  We only need a wrapper funktion placed between task and scheduler.

- Character: eliminate or summarize picture and anim picture.
  only support dsl for seperation between these two.
  simpler smaller interface.

- C wrapper: hide c++ implementation and use the struct keyword.
  could use the class also in c interface but look like struct.
  compile the plugin with c++ compiler but use c preprocessor
  or similar techniques to avoid redefining a struct with a class within.

- Make a scenegraph. trough out movement of collider and text. 
  just dock them to the charater and propagate the movements
  - kill message yobject movs
  - kill chollider movs

- Unification: make everything a big scene object. picture, npc, character. 
  (see character anim interface TODO)
  its simpler for beginners and only need a bit of ram.

- C interface : throw out id interface. c++ and c interface should match.

- Wait: add wait statement as subtask and dsl.
  add example with clock.
  - make a subtask
  - kill wait in messagesubtask

- clean up choice object. build top down instead bottom up. change interface.

- add relative positions between 0 and 1

- Character statemachines:
  - add action structs (walk action with start and end coordinates)
  - record: current action and previuos action 
    (usefull e.g for pong. have the vector. or when you stop and solve the collision)
  - let collision be an edge in this statemachine.

-Eliminate Picture and Message by merging with the yobjects.
 a yobject should be the smallest class.

-Unify the lock concept for character: all setter and getter should lock automatically
